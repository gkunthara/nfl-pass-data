# Why don't NFL teams throw a deep pass every play?

While watching NFL games, I feel as if whenever a deep pass is thrown (a pass > 20 yards down the field) the receiver either catches it or defensive pass interference is called. So I thought I'd do some more research into whether this is actually true or not. ðŸ˜€

## Some questions I'm looking to answer:

* What % of deep passes result in a pass interference penalty?
* What % of deep passes result in a catch? 
* What % of deep passes result in an interception?
