# Why don't teams throw a deep pass every play?

While watching NFL games, I feel like whenever a deep pass is thrown (a pass > 20 yards down the field) the receiver either catches it or defensive pass interference is called. So I thought I'd do some more research into whether this is actually true or not. ðŸ˜€

## Some questions I'm looking to answer:
* How many deep balls actually result in a catch or defensive pass interference?
* How likely is an interception on a deep ball? Is the reward worth the risk? Are interceptions actually more frequent on deep passes?
* Do teams that throw the deep ball more actually score more?
* What is the defense showing when there is a deep ball thrown? (blitz, zone, or man coverage)
